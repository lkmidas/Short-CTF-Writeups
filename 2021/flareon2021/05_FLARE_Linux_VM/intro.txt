Because of your superior performance throughout the FLARE-ON 8 Challenge, the FLARE team has invited you to their office to hand you a special prize! Ooh – a special prize from FLARE ? What could it be? You are led by a strong bald man with a strange sense of humor into a very nice conference room with very thick LED dimming glass. As you overhear him mumbling about a party and its shopping list you notice a sleek surveillance camera. The door locks shut!

Excited, you are now waiting in a conference room with an old and odd looking computer on the table. The door is closed with a digital lock with a full keyboard on it.

Now you realise… The prize was a trap! They love escape rooms and have locked you up in the office to make you test out their latest and greatest escape room technology. The only way out is the door – but it locked and it appears you have to enter a special code to get out. You notice the glyph for U+2691 on it. You turn you attention to the Linux computer - it seems to have been infected by some sort of malware that has encrypted everything in the documents directory, including any potential clues.

Escape the FLARE Linux VM to get the flag - hopefully it will be enough to find your way out.

Hints:
- You can import "FLARE Linux VM.ovf" with both VMWare and VirtualBox.
- Log in as 'root' using the password 'flare'
- If you use VirtualBox and want to use ssh, you may need to enable port forwarding. The following link explains how to do it: https://nsrc.org/workshops/2014/btnog/raw-attachment/wiki/Track2Agenda/ex-virtualbox-portforward-ssh.htm
